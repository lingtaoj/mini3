Comparing React Native 

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework which is used to develop applications for iOS, Android and web.
React Native can allows you to use the same technology to build apps on different mobile platforms. The way that React Native builds an app resembles the creation of web application. However, web components are replaced by native ones.

React Native Pros and Cons
Pros
1.	Single codebase: This is the main privilege of all cross-platform frameworks including React Native. Instead of building two separate apps, developers can reuse most of the JS code for both Android and iOS. 

2.	Opensource

3.	You can reuse plenty of accessible components in other projects which is a substantial bonus to your endeavors.

4.	The development time is cut, and productivity goes up due to hot reloading. With this feature, the app is kept running, and new versions of files that you edit at runtime are updated. Now, tweaking the UI is not accompanied by any loss of your state. An engineer immediately sees changes in the app.

5.	React Native leverages declarative programming for creating a mobile UI. That approach facilitates the coding process and makes the code readable and flexible, which is extremely important when new engineers join the project.

Cons

1.	Some specific APIs are not available.

2.	Each platform has a specific design language and navigation patterns – iOS has been stricter for a very long time, and Android is catching up with material design. React Native provides the automatic transformation of the graphical elements according to the required platform. However, there might be some placement issues. As a result, you have to dive deep into the code and figure out how to adjust to the design guidelines.

3.	Unlike native frameworks that ensure access to other native applications, React Native requires the use of third-party libraries or native modules to implement any integration no matter what technology you’re using.
